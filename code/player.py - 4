#For all comments to this module, the word player refers to the user providing input, while the word character refers
#to the in game rendition of the model that carries out these commands.

#This module is for all things regarding the character including player input, basic animations, abilities, and stats.
#Starts by bringing in other functions and variables from the settings, support, and entity modules
#These are for use in this module and most regard variables surrounding the character model and its potential states.
